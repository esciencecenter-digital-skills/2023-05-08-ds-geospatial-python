## üîß Exercises

## üß† Collaborative Notes
Remember, yesterday we saved a query to `json`. We then loaded the raster data of the first matched object as follows:

```python=
import pystac
items = pystac.ItemCollection.from_file("search.json")
nir09_href = items[0].assets["nir09"].href
import rioxarray
raster = rioxarray.open_rasterio(nir09_href)
```

## Coordinates (CRS)
We can look at the coordinate reference system that our data is in:

```python=
print(raster.rio.crs)
```

This displays a code of an international CRS reference identifier (EPSG in this case). We need to use another library to project our data to other coordinate systems: `pyproj`. This is a front-end for PROJ4, a well known and much used C++ library.

```python=
print(type(raster.rio.crs))

import pyproj

epsg_code = raster.rio.crs.to_epsg()
crs = pyproj.CRS(epsg_code)

print(type(crs))
```

Now we have an object that PyProj will understand.


#### Exercise: find the axes units of the CRS

What units are our coordinates in? See if you can find a method to examine this information using `help(crs)` or `dir(crs)`

When we run `dir(crs)` we see a lot of methods of the `CRS` class, but also many `__class__` like attributes. These are so called *magic* methods and tell Python how a lot of standard operations should be performed on this object; think of: creating an object, comparison with `==`, conversion to strings, you name it. The `help(crs)` command shows more documentation. This is usually the same documentation as is normally listed in [API documentation](https://pyproj4.github.io/) online. See: [CRS](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/api/crs/crs.html).

We can either run `crs.axis_info`, `crs.coordinate_system` or just show `crs` in Jupyter.

### Continuing

```python=
raster_reproject = raster.rio.reproject(4326)
raster_reproject.plot(robust=True)
```

You can lookup any CRS in [epsg.io](epsg.io). This is WGS84.

### Missing values

We may suppose that the `0` values at the edges of our data are actually missing data. It would be better to actually label these values as `missing`. Then subsequent analysis can deal with those in a more proper way.

```python=
raster.rio.nodata
```

This tells us that `0` is actually the code for missing data!

Numpy gives us access to `NaN` values that we can use to mark missing data.

```python=
import numpy as np
np.nan
```

```python=
raster_masked = rioxarray.open_rasterio(nir09_href, masked=True)
```

Now the zeros in our data have been replaced with `NaN`.

We can now do better statistics on the raster data:

```python=
raster_masked.min()
raster_masked.max()
raster_masked.mean()
# ... etc
```

Why is this info in `xarray` format? We can use these functions to run the operations along (one or more) specified axes. Then the return value is actually an array.

```python=
raster_masked.max(dim=("x",))
```

## Multiband rasters

```python=
visual_href = items[0].assets["visual"].href
visual = rioxarray.open_rasterio(visual_href, masked=True)
visual
```

Downloading this data, for example by calling `visual.plot()` is possible but will take (a lot of) time.

```python=
visual_overview_0 = rioxarray.open_rasterio(visual_href, overview_level=0)
visual_overview_0
```

This is a down-sampled version by a factor of 2, so only a quarter of the values.

```python=
visual_overview_1 = rioxarray.open_rasterio(visual_href, overview_level=1)
visual_overview_1
```

Now we get four-times smaller resolution: only one sixteenth of the amount of data.

When we try to plot an `overview_level=2` image, we only get a histogram. That's a bit disappointing.

```python=
visual_overview_2.rio.reproject(4326).plot.imshow(robust=True, figsize=(12, 12))
```

That's better!

## Vector data

```python=
import geopandas as gpd

fields = gpd.read_file("data/brpgewaspercelen_definitief_2020_small.gpkg")
fields.plot(figsize=(12, 16))
```

A good method to work with paths in Python:

```python=
from pathlib import Path

data_path = Path("../data")  # your path to your data
fields = gpd.read_file(data_path / "brpgewaspercelen_definitief_2020_small.gpkg")
fields
```

We get a table overview that you might be used to from Pandas.

```python=
fields["category"]   # or alt: fields.category
```

```python=
fields[fields["category"] == "Grasland"]
```

We can look at only the metadata, or the first 10 rows, to save time

```python=
fields_1row = gpd.read_file(data_path / "brpgewaspercelen_definitief_2020_small.gpkg", rows=1)
fields_10rows = gpd.read_file(data_path / "brpgewaspercelen_definitief_2020_small.gpkg", rows=10)
```

```python=
fields_1row.crs
fields.total_bounds
```

We can specify a bounding box at loading the data.

```python=
xmin, xmax = (120_000, 130_000)  # use underscores to make numbers nicer!
ymin, ymax = (490_000, 500_000)
fields_bbox = gpd.read_file(
    data_path / "brpgewaspercelen_definitief_2020_small.gpkg",
    bbox=(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax))
```

You can retrieve the bounds of this file without actually reading any values. `fiona` is a lower level library that `geopandas` actually uses to read data.

```python=
import fiona

with fiona.open(data_path / "brpgewaspercelen_definitief_2020_small.gpkg") as f:
    bounds = f.bounds
    crs = f.crs
```

See the [Fiona documentation](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

### Spatial query
We can use the `cx` indexer to find objects within a given bounding box.

```python=
xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax = (120_000, 135_000, 485_000, 500_000)
fields_cx = fields.cx[xmin:xmax, ymin:ymax]
fields_cx.plot()
```

We may save our selection to a file.

```python=
fields_cx.to_file(data_path / "fields_cropped.shp")
```

Other file formats are also supported: `.gpkg` for instance. (see `fiona.supported_drivers` to get a list)

```python=
wells = gpd.read_file(data_path / "brogmwvolledigeset.zip")
wells.plot(markersize=0.1)
```

We can select only the wells that are covered by the `fields` dataset.

```python=
wells_clip = wells.clip(fields_cx)
```

This gives us an error: these datasets don't have the same coordinate system. We first need to convert the wells to RD coordinates.

```python=
wells_clip = wells.to_crs(fields_cx.crs).clip(fields_cx)
```

Let's combine the two data sets in one plot.

```python=
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# create empty canvas with a single plot inside
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
fields_cx.plot(ax=ax)
wells_clip.plot(ax=ax, color='r')
```

These are only the wells that are exactly inside a field. Many will be just outside a field. We use *buffer areas* to select a radius around the fields.

```python=
buffer = fields_cx.buffer(50)
buffer.plot()
```

```python=
wells_clip_buffer = wells.clip(buffer)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 12))
fields_cx.plot(ax=ax)
wells_clip.plot(ax=ax, color='r')
```

For multiple subplots:

```python=
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2,1)

for ax, geom in zip(axes, [fields_cx, wells_clip_buffer]):
    geom.plot(ax=ax)
```

Buffer when used on a geodata frame returns a geoseries which cannot be acted upon by the dissolve function. The dissolve function works only on a geodata frame.

```python=
fields_buffer = fields_cx.copy()
fields_buffer["geometry"] = buffer
```

Now we have the same data frame as before, but the geometries are those of the buffer. We can create a single polygon from the buffer.

```python=
fields_buffer_dissolve = fields_buffer.dissolve()
```

```python=
fields_buffer_dissolve["geometry"][0]
```

Now we have a ShapeLy object. We can call `explode()` to get all connected components.

```python
fields_buffer_dissolve.explode()
```

We can clip again, this should be faster.

```python=
wells_clip_buffer_dissolved = wells.clip(fields_buffer_dissolve)
wells_clip_buffer_dissolved.plot()
```

#### Exercise: clip fields within 500m from the wells
This time, we will do a selection the other way around. Can you clip `fields` with the 500m buffer of `wells`? Please visualize the results.

If you would like to load the two datasets again, use:

```python
fields = gpd.read_file("fields_cropped.shp")
wells = gpd.read_file("data/brogmwvolledigeset.zip")
```

- Hint 1: The `wells` object contains all the wells in the Netherlands. It might be too big to call `.buffer()` function directly on it. To improve the performance, first crop it with the bounding box of the fields.

- Hint 2: If you load the data again, do not forget the CRS conversion. The file `brogmwvolledigeset.zip` is in CRS 4326.
